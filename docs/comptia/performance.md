  - Mobile Device management
    - MDM solutions can enforce security policies and monitor user behaviour and generate alerts.
- CEO: 
  - Location services
- CTO: 
  - Geofencing
    - Can alter capabilities of a device and turn functionality on or off to limit mobile device function based on location
- Infrastructure manager: 
  - Hotspots
- Devops: 
  - MicroSD HSM

### HTTP connections and certificates

> Junior Pen Test: 
> - Browsing website using IP address. 
> - Browser displays certificate error

- Issue: Cert configured with FQDN
    - Connect with FQDN, Not IP address
- Solution: Connect with HTTPS
  - https://www.comptia.org 

> Program Manager:
> - Cert cibfugred right
> - Client related?

- Issue: Missing Chain of Trust
    - Dont use FQDN, Use the IP
- Solution: 
  - Connect with IP
  - Install root CA-G2 Cert
  - Install secure CA-G2 Cert

### Remote connection 

> Choose remote connect method for robust security and scaleability
> Authentication strat with asymmetric tech
> Layers of security for user authentication

1. Remote Access Method:
   1. VPN
2. User Authentication:
   1. MFA
3. Device Authentication:
   1. Pub Key 

> Key security Considerations for remote access

- [ ] Firewall rules Based on user Roles
- [ ] Encrypted Log storage
- [ ] IDS 
- [ ] Disable Clipboard Sharing
- [ ] Secure Data Transmission
- [ ] Enable Rate Limiting on Login Attempts

> Best Solution: Cloud
   1. Recomendations:
      1. Multi Venders
      2. Power Reduendency
      3. Resilant Backups



Data deduplication is a technique used in data storage and management to eliminate duplicate copies of data.

Corrective operational controls are measures taken to address and rectify issues, deficiencies, or deviations identified in a system, process, or operation.
