## Performance Questions

### Log Analysis

![Logs](img/loganalysis.png)

<p><u> Mitigation Actions</u> </p>

1. `Data Loss Prevention` to address the unauthorized data transfer issue by monitoring and controlling data transfers across the company network. 
2. `Email Content Filtering` by inspecting email content and blocking transfers.
3. `Restricting After-Hours Server Access` by limiting time frames the servers are accessible. 
  
<p><u> Data Transfers</u> </p>

- `HTTPS`

<p><u> Web Applications</u> </p>

- Cipher: `AES-256-GCM-SHA384`
- TLS Version: `1.3`

<p><u> Compliance Considerations</u> </p>

- `HIPPA`

### Situation

- Security Engineer: 
  - Mobile Device management
    - MDM solutions can enforce security policies and monitor user behaviour and generate alerts.
- CEO: 
  - Location services
- CTO: 
  - Geofencing
    - Can alter capabilities of a device and turn functionality on or off to limit mobile device function based on location
- Infrastructure manager: 
  - Hotspots
- Devops: 
  - MicroSD HSM
    - Hardware Security Module cards can work with existing MDM software for authentication and Public Key Infrastructure functions.
- Accountant: 
  - Remote wipe

### IP Connections / FQDN and certificates

> Junior Pen Test: 
> - Browsing website using IP address. 
> - Browser displays certificate error

- Issue: Cert configured with FQDN
    - Connect with FQDN, Not IP address
- Solution: Connect with HTTPS
  - https://www.comptia.org 

> Program Manager:
> - Cert cibfugred right
> - Client related?

- Issue: Server rejects a certificate
  - Missing Chain of Trust
    - Missing Root/Intermediate CA certs
    - Dont use FQDN, Use the IP
- Solution: 
  - Install root CA-G2 Cert
  - Install secure CA-G2 Cert

### Remote connection 

> Choose remote connect method for robust security and scaleability
> Authentication strat with asymmetric tech
> Layers of security for user authentication

1. Remote Access Method:
   1. VPN
2. User Authentication:
   1. MFA
3. Device Authentication:
   1. Pub Key 

> Key security Considerations for remote access

- [ ] Firewall rules Based on user Roles
- [ ] Encrypted Log storage
- [ ] IDS 
- [ ] Disable Clipboard Sharing
- [ ] Secure Data Transmission
- [ ] Enable Rate Limiting on Login Attempts
