- **Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)**: An email security protocol which enables domain owners to specify how email from their domain should be authenticated and handled if it fails authentication checks.
  - Prevents email spoofing and moves messages to quarantine or spam
- **Sender Policy Framework (SPF)**: Enables domain owners to define which IP addresses are authorized to send emails for their domain to prevent sender address forgery.

### <TextColor lightColor="#000000" darkColor="#E3D4AD">Web Filter</TextColor>

- **Universal Resource Locator (URL) Scanning**: The process of automatically inspecting and analyzing URLs to detect and mitigate security risks.
- **Reputation-Based Filtering**: A security technique that evaluates and filters online resources based on their historical reputation and trustworthiness.

## <TextColor lightColor="#064CD5" darkColor="#EF1761">4.6 Identity and Access Management</TextColor>

### <TextColor lightColor="#000000" darkColor="#E3D4AD">Single Sign-On (SSO)</TextColor>

- **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: A protocol to access and manage a centralized directory service containing user identities, authentication creds, and access control information.
- **Open Authorization (OAuth)**: A protocol which allows users to authorizes third-party applications to access their resources without sharing login credentials. 
  - Aligns with the principle of least privilege. 
- **Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML)**: Protocol which allows the exchange of authentication and authorization information between an identity provider and a service provider. Enables SSO

### <TextColor lightColor="#000000" darkColor="#E3D4AD">Access Controls</TextColor>

- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: A model where the owner of a resource controls access permissions and decides who can access the resource and what actions they can perform
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Enforces access permissions based on data sensitivity and **predefined** security labels. Centrally controlled.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns access permissions based on job roles and responsibilities to streamline management processes. It does not enforce control.
- **Least Privilege**: The principle of Least Privilege ensures that users, applications, and systems are granted the minimum necessary access to perform their tasks.
