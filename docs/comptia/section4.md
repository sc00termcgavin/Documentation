## 4.2 Security Implications of proper hardware, software, and data asset management

### Disposal/Decommissioning

- **Certification**: Validating and verifying that systems, processes, or devices meet specific security standards and compliance requirements.
- **Data Retention**: Policies governing storage and the preservation of information 
- **Destruction**: The secure and irreversible elimination of data or IT assets to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Sanitization**: Removal or alteration of data from storage devices to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or accessed.

## 4.3 Vulnerability Management

### Identification

- **Responsible disclosure program**: Set of policies and practices designed to manage the identification, reporting, and resolution of security vulnerabilities discovered by external parties.

### Analysis

- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**: Quantitative scoring from 0 to 10 based on the characteristics of a vulnerability. 
- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**: Dictionary of common vulnerabilities sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)

### Vulnerability Response and Remediation

- **Insurance**: Provides financial protection in case of a security breach resulting from a vulnerability
- **Patching**: Remediation to take care of majority of vulnerabilities.

## 4.4 Security Alerting and Monitoring

### Activities

- **Alert Response and Remediation/Validation**: The process and actions taken to address and resolve security alerts generated by monitoring systems.
  - **Alert Tuning**: Refine detection rules and muting alert levels.
  - **Quarantine**: Isolating potentially harmful or compromised components to prevent them from causing further damage or spreading threats within a network.

### Tools

- **Agents**: Software components that are installed directly on systems, devices, or applications being monitored.
- **Antivirus (A-V)**: Detect and remove infections.
- **Data loss prevention (DLP)**: Protects information and mediates the copying of tagged data to restrict it to authorized media and services and monitors statistics for policy violations.
- **NetFlow**: NetFlow collectors capture metadata and statistics about network traffic to identify patterns and anomalies.
- **Security content automation protocol (SCAP)**: Suite of standards used to automate the processes of vulnerability management. Allows scanners to determine if a computer meets configuration baselines.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Real-time analysis of security alerts generated by IT infrastructure components to aid in incident response.
- **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap**: A type of message sent by an SNMP-enabled device such as a server, to an SNMP manager to alert different events such as CPU events.

- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Automated tools designed to identify, assess, and report on security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. 


## 4.5 Enterprise Security Capabilities

### Email Security

- **DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)**: Email authentication which allows the sender to digitally sign their emails using a private key and verified by the recipient via a public key published in the sender's DNS records.
- **Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)**: An email security protocol which enables domain owners to specify how email from their domain should be authenticated and handled if it fails authentication checks.
  - Prevents email spoofing and moves messages to quarantine or spam
- **Sender Policy Framework (SPF)**: Enables domain owners to define which IP addresses are authorized to send emails for their domain to prevent sender address forgery.

### Web Filter

- **Universal Resource Locator (URL) Scanning**: The process of automatically inspecting and analyzing URLs to detect and mitigate security risks.
- **Reputation-Based Filtering**: A security technique that evaluates and filters online resources based on their historical reputation and trustworthiness.


## 4.6 Identity and Access Management

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

- **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: A protocol to access and manage a centralized directory service containing user identities, authentication creds, and access control information.
- **Open Authorization (OAuth)**: A protocol which allows users to authorizes third-party applications to access their resources without sharing login credentials. 
- **Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML)**: Protocol which allows the exchange of authentication and authorization information between an identity provider and a service provider. Enables SSO

### Access Controls

- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Enforces access permissions based on user characteristics, resource properties, and environmental factors
- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: A model where the owner of a resource controls access permissions and decides who can access the resource and what actions they can perform
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Enforces access permissions based on data sensitivity and **predefined** security labels. Centrally controlled.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns access permissions based on job roles and responsibilities to streamline management processes. It does not enforce control.
- **Least Privilege**: The principle of Least Privilege ensures that users, applications, and systems are granted the minimum necessary access to perform their tasks.

## 4.7 Automation and Orchestration

### Use Cases of Automation and Scripting

- **Guardrail**: Framework for managing security policies and to ensure that automated processes operate within defined boundaries, reducing the risk of security breaches and operational issues by preventing unauthorized actions and maintaining adherence to security protocols.
- **Resource Provisioning**: Allocates IT resources such as servers, storage, and networks to applications and users.
- **User Provisioning**: Involves automating and orchestrating the creation, modification, and removal of user accounts and their associated permissions.

### Benefits

- **Workforce Multiplier**: A concept where automation and orchestration technologies amplify the effectiveness of security personnel by automating routine tasks, improving efficiency, and allowing security teams to focus on more strategic and complex issues.

### Challanges

- **Technical Debt**: Result in poorly documented code.
- **Single Points of Failure**: Impacting multiple areas of the organization and causing widespread problems.
- **Cost**: A challenge can involve funding, recognizing that the initial cost of implementing automation and orchestration can be high, including costs associated with acquiring and developing appropriate tools and integrating them into existing systems.

## 4.8 Incident Response Activities

### Process

- **Preparation**: Creating and updating incident response policies, procedures, and plans, and equipping the team with the necessary tools and training.
- **Detection**: Monitoring and analyzing systems to detect anomalies or breaches.
- **Analysis**: Gathering and analyzing evidence to determine the impact and the cause of the incident.
- **Containment**: Isolating affected systems and stopping the incident from worsening.
- **Eradication**: Ensures that the threat is fully addressed and does not recur.
- **Recovery**: Resuming regular business functions and monitoring for any signs of residual issues.
- **Lessons Learned**: This stage focuses on understanding what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how to improve incident response efforts.

## 4.9 Logs and Data Sources

### Log Data

- **Application Logs**: Records generated by software applications which provide detailed information about application activities. They support investigations by offering insights into application-level behavior.
- **Endpoint Logs**: Events monitored by security software running on the host rather than the OS itself.
- **Firewall Logs**: Detailed records maintained by a firewall that captures information a bout network traffic that records a data and time stamp.
- **IPS/IDS Logs**: These logs support investigations by providing detailed insights into network traffic anomalies, intrusion attempts, and patterns indicative of malicious activity.
- **Metadata**: Descriptive data that provides information about other data, including attributes like file names, creation and modification dates, authorship, file size, and access permissions.
- **Network Logs**: Records created by network devices that track and document network traffic, connection attempts, data flows, and other network activities.
- **OS-specific Security Logs**: Records generated by an operating system that documents events such as user logins, failed attempts, and system access.
- **User Behavior Analytics Logs (UBA)**: User behavior insights, gateway logs encrypted with hash message authentication code (HMAC) ensure integrity and system-specific security logs with integrity verification (IV) validate system activities, analyzing sophisticated attacks comprehensively.
